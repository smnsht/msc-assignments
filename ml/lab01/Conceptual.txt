	(a) better - a more flexible approach will fit the data better

	(b) worse - small number of observations

	(c) better - flexible model will have a better fit

	(d) worse


2. 
	(a) regression. CEO salary based on firm's features.
		n - 500 firms in the US
		p - profit, number of employees, industry, CEO salary

	(b) classification. predicting new product's success or failure.
		n - 20 similar products previously launched
		p - price charged, marketing budget, comp. price, ten other variables

	(c) regression. % change
		n - 52 weeks
		p - %change in US market, %change in British market, %change in German market


6. 
	A parametric approach reduces the problem of estimating f down to one of estimating a set of 
	parameters because it assumes a form for f.

	A non-parametric approach does not assume a functional form for f and so requires a very large 
	number of observations to accurately estimate f.

	The advantages of a parametric approach to regression or classification are the simplifying of modeling f 
	to a few parameters and not as many observations are required compared to a non-parametric approach.

	The disadvantages of a parametric approach to regression or classification
	are a potential to inaccurately estimate f if the form of f assumed is wrong or
	to overfit the observations if more flexible models are used.
